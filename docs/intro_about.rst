About Procrustes
================

`Procrustes <https://github.com/theochem/procrustes>`_ is a free and open source Python library for
(generalized) Procrustes Problems. Procrustes problems arise when one wishes to find one or two
transformations (which can be permutations, rotations, unitary, or symmetric) that make one matrix,
:math:`\mathbf{A}` resemble a second "target" matrix :math:`\mathbf{B}` as closely as possible:

    .. math::
        \underbrace{\min}_{\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{T}} \| \mathbf{S}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{T} -
        \mathbf{B}\|_{F}^2
where :math:`\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}` is the input matrix,
:math:`\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}` is the reference (target) matrix, and
:math:`\| \cdot \|_{F}` denotes the Frobenius norm defined as,

.. math::

    \begin{split}
        \\\| \mathbf{A} \|_{F}
        & = \sqrt{\sum^m_{i=1} \sum^n_{j=1} |a_{ij}|^2} \\
        & = \sqrt{ \text{Tr} (\mathbf{A}^{\dagger} \mathbf{A})} \\
        & = \sqrt{ \sum^{\min \{m, n \}}_{i=1} \rho^2_i (\mathbf{A})}
    \end{split}

Here :math:`a_{ij}`, :math:`\text{Tr}(\mathbf{A})`, and :math:`\rho^2_i (\mathbf{A})` denotes the
element :math:`ij`, trace, and singular values of the matrix of :math:`\mathbf{A}`, respectively.

Different Procrustes problems use different choices for the transformation matrices
:math:`\mathbf{S}` and :math:`\mathbf{T}` which are commonly taken to be orthogonal/unitary
matrices, rotation matrices, symmetric matrices, or permutation matrices. When :math:`\mathbf{S}`
is an identity matrix, it is called a one-sided Procrustes problem :cite:`GPA_Gower`, and when it is
equal to :math:`\mathbf{T}`, it becomes two-sided Procrustes problem with one transformation.

Procrustes problems arise when aligning molecules and other objects, when evaluating optimal basis
transformations, when determining optimal mappings between sets, and in many other contexts. This
package includes options to translate, scale, and zero-pad matrices, so that matrices with different
centers/scaling/sizes can be considered.
