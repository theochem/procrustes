In order to show how to use Procrustes, we have implemented some practical examples. The user can
download the jupyter notebook from our github repo or just use the online version.

.. todo::
   #. Add Jupyter notebook into github repo
   #. Try to fix library import problems for online jupyter server (nbviewer, mybinder and colab by
      Google)
